## What I Learned

This project was a comprehensive learning experience that allowed me to refine my skills in frontend development. Here are the key takeaways:

- **GSAP Animations**:  
  - Implemented advanced animations using GSAP, including the `TextPlugin` for typewriter effects and `ScrollTrigger` for scroll-based animations.  
  - Learned how to create reusable timelines and manage animation states effectively.  

- **Lenis Smooth Scroll**:  
  - Integrated the Lenis Smooth Scroll Library for a seamless scrolling experience.  
  - Fixed issues with scroll lag and ensured compatibility with GSAP's `ScrollTrigger`.  

- **Theme Switching**:  
  - Developed a light/dark theme toggle with smooth transitions.  
  - Used local storage to persist user preferences across sessions.  
  - Enhanced the user experience by ensuring all elements, including icons and buttons, adapt to the selected theme.  

- **DOM Manipulation**:  
  - Efficiently manipulated the DOM to handle dynamic content, animations, and user interactions.  
  - Improved performance by optimizing event listeners and reducing redundant DOM queries.  

- **Error Handling**:  
  - Implemented robust error handling for fetch requests, ensuring users receive clear feedback in case of failures.  

- **Responsive Design**:  
  - Applied a mobile-first approach to ensure the website looks great on all screen sizes.  
  - Used media queries and flexible layouts to adapt the design seamlessly.  

- **Custom Cursor and Magneto Button**:  
  - Created a custom animated cursor and a "magneto" button effect using GSAP for an interactive user experience.  
  - Fixed alignment and responsiveness issues for these elements.  

- **Loading States**:  
  - Added a preloader animation to enhance the initial user experience.  
  - Ensured the loader disappears smoothly after the page content is ready.  

- **Code Optimization**:  
  - Refactored JavaScript code to improve readability and maintainability.  
  - Organized CSS styles for better scalability and ensured consistent use of variables for colors and transitions.  

- **Accessibility Improvements**:  
  - Ensured proper semantic HTML structure for better accessibility.  
  - Added alt attributes to images and improved keyboard navigation.
